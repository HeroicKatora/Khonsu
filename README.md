# Khonsu

A set of calendar and task tracking utilities.

`Khonsu` is not a single black-box application. Rather, it is a set of libraries
and event sources that can be driven by a diverse set of front-ends to provide
what would usually be expected from a calendar utility. That makes it possible
to easily show and manage the same entries from a tui or a website.

See [design.md](doc/design.md) or [architecture.md](doc/architecture.md) for
more details on the project basics.

## Project status

This project is in its concept phase. All of the above features will get added
over time, in a span of months or years, not weeks. While this might seem slow
compared to webapps, the goal is to be more stable, more free, and considerably
more extensive than most other.

## Development

Except while fleshing out the initial ideas, this project is developed using
RFCs. That means you don't have to code to help! The course of action is opening
an issue describing the potential improvement, discussing advantages and
disadvantages, and waiting for feedback. After the RFC is accepted, the
necessary implementation work will get a tracking issue to follow progress of
the realization. Usual bug reports and pull requests to advance other issues are
still welcome.

## Name

`Khonsu` is a latin transcription of the/an egyptian god of time.
